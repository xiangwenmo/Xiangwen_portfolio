      <description>Overview This is the third project for BIOSTAT 823 (2020 Fall)
This project requires to include 3 informative visualizations about malaria using Python and Malaria Dataset from github.
The detailed solution and codes are in here.
Graph 1: Malaria death by age I used dataset malaria_deaths_age.csv to plot the graph.
  From the graph we can see that young children are more vulnerable to the malaria disease. Especially for under 5 age group, which takes nearly half of the total deaths.</description>
