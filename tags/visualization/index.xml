      <description>Overview This is the seventh project for BIOSTAT 823 (2020 Fall). This project requires to train a deep learning model to classify beetles, cockroaches and dragonflies using these insect images. (Original images).
I decided to use Yann LeCun&amp;rsquo;s Convolutional Neural Network architecture (LeNet5) and made some adjustment. The most application of it is recoginizing simple digit images, which is kind of what we are trying to do for this problem.</description>

      <description>Overview This is the sixth project for BIOSTAT 823 (2020 Fall)
This project requires to download data of PhD awarded in the US and make a dashboard visualization of some aspects of the data.
Dashboard I used dash to create my dashboard by following the online tutorial.
You can check my dashboard here: Dashboard: Doctorate Recipients from US universities
Data I am interested in investigating which fields attract students and the demographics in each field.</description>

      <title>Project 3: Visualization about Malaria</title>

      <description>Overview This is the third project for BIOSTAT 823 (2020 Fall)
This project requires to include 3 informative visualizations about malaria using Python and Malaria Dataset from github.
The detailed solution and codes are in here.
Graph 1: Malaria death by age I used dataset malaria_deaths_age.csv to plot the graph.
  From the graph we can see that young children are more vulnerable to the malaria disease. Especially for under 5 age group, which takes nearly half of the total deaths.</description>
