      <description>Overview This is the fourth project for BIOSTAT 823 (2020 Fall)
This project requires to Create a SQLite3 schema to store spotify data in at least 3rd normal form (3NF) and use an SQL query to find the names of all playlists that contain instrumentals
I used python to do the normalization and stored the transformed dataframe into a SQL database. I&amp;rsquo;ll show how I do it in the following sections:</description>

      <description>Overview This is the third project for BIOSTAT 823 (2020 Fall)
This project requires to include 3 informative visualizations about malaria using Python and Malaria Dataset from github.
The detailed solution and codes are in here.
Graph 1: Malaria death by age I used dataset malaria_deaths_age.csv to plot the graph.
  From the graph we can see that young children are more vulnerable to the malaria disease. Especially for under 5 age group, which takes nearly half of the total deaths.</description>

      <description>Overview This is the second project for BIOSTAT 823 (2020 Fall)
This project requires to solve three problems from Euler&amp;rsquo;s Project. I choose my two of the problems related to decimals, and one related to prime numbers.
The detailed solution and codes are in here. I will explain my solutions to each of the problems in the following sections:
Problem 7: 10001st prime (420,695) Problem: By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.</description>
